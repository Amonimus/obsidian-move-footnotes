A primitive plugin for Obsidian to move automatic Footnotes section from the bottom of the note to the specified location.

Triggers hen plugin is loaded and when window is changed.

# Intallation

Just copy the `move-footnotes` folder into .obsidian/plugins folder and check the Community Plugins list.

# Problems

Obsidian natively renders footnotes last, much after file-open and post-processor. So the footnotes are moved properly when the mode is cahnged or the file is modified, but not when the file is opened.
